## Project 1: Bank Customer Churn - Project Overview
1. Identify and visually represent the factors that contribute to customer churn.
2. Develop a prediction model that can classify if a customer is likely to churn or not.
    * Ideally, choose a model that can also provide a probability of churn, making it easier for customer service to focus on preventing churn among customers with a higher likelihood of leaving.
    * Evaluate and select the most effective model based on its performance. So that customer service can efficiently target efforts to prevent churn.
