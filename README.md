## Project 1: Bank Customer Churn - Project Overview
1. Identify and visually represent the factors that contribute to customer churn.
2. Develop a prediction model that can classify if a customer is likely to churn or not.
    * Ideally, choose a model that can also provide a probability of churn, making it easier for customer service to focus on preventing churn among customers with a higher likelihood of leaving.
    * Evaluate and select the most effective model based on its performance. So that customer service can efficiently target efforts to prevent churn.

## Project 2: Stress, Anxiety & Depression Prediction - Project Overview
* This research focused on detecting anxiety, depression and stress using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale questionnaire. Data were collected from a total of 39775 participants via data hosted on OpenPsychometrics.org a nonprofit effort to educate the public about psychology and to collect data for psychological research. Their notes on the data collected in the codebook.txt and subsequently classified using five machine learning algorithms – namely Decision Tree, Random Forest Tree, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine and KNN.
* Engineered features by cleaning different majors, religion, status of people participated in the survey.
* The f1 score measure was added, which helped identify the best accuracy model among the five applied algorithms as the Random Forest classifier. Furthermore, the specificity parameter revealed that the algorithms were also especially sensitive to negative results.

## Project 3: Global Development Initiative
* This database includes commitment information for over 1.5 million development finance activities funded between 1947 and 2013, covers 96 donors, and includes ODA, OOF flows, Equity Investments, and Export Credits where available.
* Analyzed how donations changed over time between 1947 and 2013.
* Examined how the identity of the donor and recipient is linked to the geographic location of each country.
* Created a visual representation to compare the amount of donations and receipts of each country, with the aim of identifying whether there are any nations that donate significantly more than they receive, or vice versa using R.
* To summarize, we found that the geographic regions play an important role in whether a country is a Donor or a Recipient. The total amount of donations in various time periods were analyzed and found that the donations peaked in 1992 for various development projects such as Rescheduling and Refinancing, Import Support, Industrial Development. The Geographical distribution of Donors and Recipients were plotted to visualize the total amount spent and received by various regions. We also noticed that each country focuses different areas to develop, for example, the United States focuses primarily on Air Transport among other developments.
